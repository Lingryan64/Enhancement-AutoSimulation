# Enhancement-AutoSimulation
Simulates classic Warcraft shamans with varying weapon Enhancements

this is more proof of concept, there are other variables that can be added, most importantly the proc per minute mechanic heavily influecning some proc chances 
if nothing is happening. Windfury and frostbrand have this effect but with different variables. Also note I left out flametongue because it was similiar to rockbiter
in being more static. Lastly there is no inclusion of crit chance added, although this can be worked in easily.
